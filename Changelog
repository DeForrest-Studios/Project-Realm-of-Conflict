 - Most float values are now rounded to the 5 decimal place.
 - Implement simulation saving, and loading
 - Guarded against players using admin commands, in what I think is a healthy manner :) <3
 - Changed time between skirmishes. From 5 minutes to 20.
 - All numbers are now base on a "Base Value" that each item has. Is a flat number for the basic materials like water, sand, logs, etc., and crafted component's base
 values are dependant on the base values of the items required to craft it.
 For Example: Iron's base value is Raw Copper's base value multiplied by 2, as crafting Iron requires 2 Raw Copper.
 - Experience gain from buying items made to a flat `cost*0.4`, meaning 0.4 xp per dollar spent.
 - Soldier stat algorithm from `range between tier*(16*tier) + tier*(14*tier) to tier*(24*tier) + tier*(18*tier)` to flat output of `cost*(2 + (tier*0.25))`
 Tier 1 Soldier = (cost*2.25)
 Tier 2 Soldier = (cost*2.5)
 Tier 3 Soldier = (cost*2.75)
 - Missile stat algorithm from `range between tier*(32*tier) + tier*(24*tier) to tier*(96*tier) + tier*(46*tier)` to `cost*3 + (tier*0.25)`
 Tier 1 Missile = (cost*3.25)
 Tier 2 Missile = (cost*3.5)
 Tier 3 Missile = (cost*3.75)
 Tier 4 Missile = (cost*4)
 Tier 5 Missile = (cost*4.25)
 - Shield stat algorithm from `range between tier*(600*tier) + tier*(8*tier) to tier*(700*tier) + tier*(12*tier)` to  `cost*3 + (tier*0.25)`
 Tier 1 Shield = (cost*3.25)
 Tier 2 Shield = (cost*3.5)
 Tier 3 Shield = (cost*3.75)
 Tier 4 Shield = (cost*4)
 Tier 5 Shield = (cost*4.25)
 - Emp stat algorithm from `range between tier*(140*tier) + tier*(8*tier) to tier*(200*tier) + tier*(12*tier)` to cost*(3.0 + (tier*0.25))
 Tier 1 EMP = cost*3.25
 Tier 2 EMP = cost*3.5
 Tier 3 EMP = cost*3.75
 - Player level effects player attack damage, and defensive power:
  attack_power = attack_power + self.level * 1+(self.level*0.4)
  defensive_power = defensive_power + self.level * 1+(self.level*0.5)

 - Fixed healing, and domination not printing out stats
 - Removed leaderboards from embeded simulation report, so we can fit more data
 - Implemented item craft; Beware, it's not very performant at the moment. It works, but I need to implement proper timeout deferring in order for performance to be better. Try not to spam craft. Craft what you need for now. thank you guy :)


~( January, 1st, 2023, Version: 0.2.1)~ Deprecated Changelog
Thank you guys for all the support. We've gotten over 50 people to take part in this project altogether just in this past week. Whether through playing and reporting bugs, helping with art, helping with lore, whatever it may be. You've all been apart of this coming together so far, and I really appreciate you all for it. With so many new people over just the past couple days, I'd like to touch bases again.
As of `~( December, 31st, 2022, Version: 0.1.0) The Crafting Update~`, I announced we are in Alpha. At the launch things were rocky. I've very well experienced with C, C++, and Python, years of them all, but I'm admittedly only a couple months into understand asynchronous programming particularly, I've just never really messed with it. I work on compilers mainly, and programming language design, which rarely uses concurrency other than actually implementing it as a feature, which I've not really done either. A big problem I'm trying to solve, is healthily creating objects asynchronously, as this is destroying performance more than anything. I'm also working on a defer "table" that holds responses for follow ups to leasen interaction failures, but this is incompatible with the current codebase(we edit messages to acheive the single-panel gameplay, deferring does not like this), so it's going to take a lot of reworking.

The next update, `0.3.0 ~ The Support Update`, is going to be implementing some support features. Medics who have healing, and defensive power. Healing fields; comes in 3 tiers, and provides massive healing. Construction of Cities, comes in 3 tiers, which provide massive defensive boosts. Contruction of Military Camps, which comes in 5 tiers, which provide small to large boosts in attack and defense.
The Support Update will probably take at least a week, maybe two depending on the quality I want to push for. During this time I will be pushing minor update on 0.2.0, like this one, 0.2.1. These will provide hotfixes, and tiny features additions, or changes relative to the UI or database.

We are currently looking for staff for the discord server, programmers, and artists who wish to help. There is no expectation of how much work you do, but there is an expectation of privacy, and effort. If you are interested in helping with programming or art, please DM me, Cavan (or Robert). If you are interested in applying for staff for the discord server, please DM Keeper Phosphorus (TheMadDM).

I'd like to thank you all one more time for the support. I hope for this project to go farther, and become better.
