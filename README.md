# Project: Realm of Conflict

## Summarization
Titan (Red) vs Analis (Blue)

The two planets war against eachother until one of the planets population falls to 0. Then the simulation resets completely. These are called "Cycles".

Players are "Protectors" whom can choose a team, or allow for the Maiden to select a team for them, giving them a permanent bonus for the simulation cycle, and are responsible for their own "Operation" against the opposing planet. All player Operations are then added together during "Skirmishes", and planet stats are affected from there.

Every simulation begins with population of 5,298,647,384,393, and the simulation is supposed to last an estimation between 2-4 weeks. This is by no means a restrict time-frame.
